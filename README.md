## Our shop and ideas

We chose to create a shop that sells potions. Our inspiration is games, fantasy and medieval times

### Designs

All designs used are made by me, Carolina.

## Techniques and Tools

For project management we used the agile working method "Scrum" to keep a flexible project that we can adapt to the design of the product and the needs of the product owner.
We used Jira to manage the project. We planned, keept track of our tasks, planning and bugs and also our shared project documents.

For the coding part of the project we used VSCode and github. For a first time group assignment it had some ups and downs but once we all got a hang of it it turned out great!

### Languages
